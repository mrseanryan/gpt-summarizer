long_summary: 'The text discusses the ability to summarize text using ChatGPT or a
  local LLM, supporting various file types like text, markdown, HTML, and PDF files.
  This feature allows users to efficiently condense information from multiple sources,
  aiding in tasks that require processing large amounts of text.

  The tool provides multi-level summarization options, allowing users to generate
  short, long, and per-paragraph summaries. Additionally, it offers translation services
  to convert text into a target language. Users can batch summarize entire directories
  of files or download files via URLs for summarization purposes, enhancing efficiency
  and accessibility.

  Private LLM offers enhanced privacy and protection of Intellectual Property by enabling
  the use of locally hosted models. Cost savings are realized through the avoidance
  of re-summarizing previously processed files and the ability to calculate cost estimates,
  particularly when utilizing Open AI. The system generates output files efficiently.

  The text highlights the advantages of YAML format, instructions for running local
  LLM, and options for summarizing text files and PDFs. It also delves into the challenges
  faced by language models with long contexts, emphasizing the impact of context length
  on performance and proposing new evaluation methods.

  The text explains file processing and cost estimation procedures, detailing the
  use of figures from config.py. It offers guidance on utilizing gpt-summary through
  remote or local LLM, with instructions on installation, configuration, and setting
  up OpenAI keys. It also covers the installation of ctransformers, model downloads,
  and GPU acceleration settings in config.py.

  The "Prompt Engineering for Developers" course by DeepLearning.ai is designed to
  help developers improve their ability to craft prompts that yield desired outcomes
  from AI models. By mastering prompt engineering techniques, participants can optimize
  the performance of AI systems in various applications.
